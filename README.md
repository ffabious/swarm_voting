# Decision Making in Robot Swarm via Majority Voting

Design and implement a distributed decision-making system for a robot swarm using majority voting. Each robot acts as an independent agent that proposes, shares, and votes on movement direction. The swarm must reach a collective decision without a central controller. Robots propose and exchange decisions until the majority wins.
